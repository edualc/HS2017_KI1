# Task 5: we are are again interested in links, but this time a connection only valid the links are descending in date 
# find out who could have actually sent an information, when imposing this new restriction
# Hints:
#   You are allowed to naively compare the dates lexicographically using ">" and "<"; it works in this example of concrete dates (but is of course evil in general)

# Task 6: at last find all the communication paths which lead to the suspect, again with the restriction that the dates have to be ordered correctly

# Final task: after seeing this information, who, if anybody, do you think has given a tipp to the suspect?
